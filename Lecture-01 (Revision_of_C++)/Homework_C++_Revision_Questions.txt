						1. Check if a number is prime – Write a C++ program to check whether a given number n is prime.

						2. Find all prime numbers up to n – Modify the prime number program to print all prime numbers from 1 to n.

						3. Find all factors of a number – Write a program to print all factors of a given number n.

						4. Sum of factors – Write a program to find the sum of all factors of a given number n.

						5. Fibonacci sequence (Recursion & Iteration) – Implement a function to print the first n Fibonacci numbers using both recursion and iteration.

						6. Nth Fibonacci number using Memoization – Optimize the Fibonacci function using memoization to improve efficiency.

						7. Factorial using recursion – Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number n.

						8. Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) – Write a program to compute the GCD of two numbers using Euclidean Algorithm.

						9. Check if a number is a Perfect Number – A number is perfect if the sum of its factors (excluding itself) equals the number. Write a program to check for perfect numbers.

						10.Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) – Implement a function to find the LCM of two numbers using the formula LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b).
